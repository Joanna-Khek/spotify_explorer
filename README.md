# Dash Spotify Explorer App
Dash App: https://joanna-spotify-explorer.herokuapp.com/

## About
I have been using Spotify for a long time and wanted to gain some insights on the type of music i frequently listen to. 
This web app allows me explore the top artists, tracks as well as audio features i've been listening to.

There are two main processes in this project. First process is to use the Spotify API to extract the relevant data i require.
Second process is to feed this data into the dash app.
